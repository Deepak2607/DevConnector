/// isAuthenticated and isNotAuthenticated middlewares

/// apply validations in routes

// add comments for all routes and wherever required

// when move to create-profile (or any link when a user is authenticated) via url, redirected to dashboard, you know the reason...but not solution

// don't want to use windows.reload() to delete profile

// add links in PostItem

// unable to access props.match.params.id in Post Route when i make it PrivateRoute

// download code of old tutorial of the same and try to solve above problems

// props.posts.map is not a function..in PostItem.js
solution is delaying

show profile data in EditProfile, check it after completing, CreateProfile also
